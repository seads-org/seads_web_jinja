# TalkItOver chatbot evaluation

#NLP #impact-evaluation #strategy

[TalkItOver](https://github.com/SanjayRedScarf/talkitover2) is a mental health chatbot inspired by the [Samaritans'](https://www.samaritans.org/) methodology.

For this project we:

- evaluated its expected impact
- analyzed conversation data to determine the situations where the bot helps the clients and where it doesn't
- proposed potential improvements in the bot algorithm based on our findings
- provided advice for the strategic development of the project
