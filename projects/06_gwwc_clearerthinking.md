# Designing a donation tool with ClearerThinking and GWWC

#analytics #survey

ClearerThinking developed [a tool](https://programs.clearerthinking.org/how_to_do_more_good.html) that helps people to understand their values and decide on the best way to maximize their positive impact. For [Giving What We Can](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/), our team analyzed user responses from this tool to obtain insights that could inform the development of a similar one for deciding on target charities for donations.
