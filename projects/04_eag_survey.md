# EAG survey data analysis

#analytics #survey #seads-v1

On behalf of CEA, SEADS analyzed survey data for EA Global events (as well as EAGx and EAG Virtual events) ranging from 2016 to 2020. We estimated value based on how likely articipants were to recommend future conferences. We concluded from our analysis that community-related variables (such as feeling welcome or making connections with new people) are more closely linked to this likelihood than content-related variables (such as enjoyment of speaker sessions). Our demographic analysis of community-related variables yielded no significant differences based on participantsâ€™ age, ethnicity, or gender.
